                            <p>Mice not only live inside, but outside near foundations – in shrubbery, weeds, crawlspaces, basements or garages. They eat almost anything, but prefer cereal grains, seeds or sweet material requiring very little water to survive. When it gets colder, they move inside nesting closer to a food supply. These nests are found in many places, including in walls, ceiling voids, storage boxes, drawers, under major appliances or within the upholstery of furniture. </p>
                            <p><strong>Identifying Characteristics:</strong> The adult house mouse is small and slender, about 1-2 inches long, excluding tail. It has large ears, a pointed nose and small eyes. The tail is as long as the head and body combined. The fur color varies, but it is usually a light gray or brown, but could be darker shades. </p>

                            <p>These rats are sometimes called brown or sewer rats. They are stocky burrowing rodents that are larger than roof rats. Their burrows are found along building foundations, beneath rubbish or woodpiles, and in moist areas in and around gardens and fields. Nests can be lined with shredded paper, cloth or other fibrous material. When Norway rats invade buildings, they usually remain in the basement or ground floor. </p>
                            <p><strong>Identifying Characteristics:</strong> The Norway rat is large, robust and between 7-18 ounces. The tail is shorter than the body, dark above and pale below.</p>

These rats enter your home much like squirrels. As their population grows they will nest in underground burrows. They prefer seeds, nuts, fresh vegetables and fruits, but will eat meat and grain products. They become sexually mature in 2-3 months, with 4-6 liters per year, 4-8 pups per litter.</p>
                            <p><strong>Identifying Characteristics:</strong> Adults weigh about 5-9 ounces, 7-10 inches long. The tail is longer than the head and body combined. They have smooth (not shaggy) fur, large ears and a pointed nose. </p>

                            <p>The black widow spider is the most common and harmful spider in PestVault. Venom from its bite can cause reactions ranging from mild to painful and serious, but death is very unlikely and many symptoms can be alleviated if medical treatment is obtained. They and their associated webs usually are found in dark, dry, sheltered, relatively undisturbed places, such as among piles of wood, rubbish or stones, in culverts, hollow stumps and old animal burrows. They can also be found in garages, sheds, barns, crawlspaces, utility meter boxes and outhouses, and sometimes among plants.</p>
                            <p><strong>Identifying Characteristics:</strong> The typical adult female black widow has a shiny black body, slender black legs and a red or orange mark in the shape of an hourglass on the underside of the large, round abdomen.

                            <p>Most often, these are found in the ears, between the toes and on the backs of dogs. After feeding, they retire to molding, baseboards, around window-cord pulleys, any protected openings.</p>
                            <p><strong>Identifying Characteristics:</strong> Adult ticks are flat, about 1/8″ long and uniformly red-brown with tiny pits scattered over the back. Unlike the male, the female enlarges after feeding to about 1/2″ long and 1/4″ wide. The enlarged portion of the body becomes gray-blue to olive in color.</p>

                            <p>Earwigs are active at night and hide in cracks or underneath objects during the day. Most species scavenge on dead animal and plant material. Eggs are laid in underground burrows.</p>
                            <p><strong>Identifying Characteristics:</strong> Earwigs are most readily recognized by the forceps at the end of the abdomen. Species range from 1/2″ to 1″ in length, and from light reddish-brown to jet-black in color. Some species are marked with stripe or bands on body and legs.</p>

                            <p>The names “wood wasp” and “horntail” describe several kinds of wood-boring insects. Of greatest concern are the large, non-stinging wasps that normally are attracted to and complete their life cycles in newly dead or dying conifer trees. Timber salvaged from these trees can be processed into infested lumber. This can lead to adult wasps emerging in recently completed buildings or structures. Although these insects are extremely annoying, they aren’t harmful to humans or structures. They attack only trees and won’t bore into wood in buildings or furniture.</p>
                            <p><strong>Identifying Characteristics:</strong> The dozen species of wood wasps in PestVault look similar. They are large insects, generally 1” or longer and wasp-like in appearance, but have an elongated, cylindrical body without a noticeable constriction or “waist.” They often are black or metallic dark blue or a combination of black, red and yellow. They make a noisy buzz when flying.</p>
